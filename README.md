This is a Github repository accompanying research project "Derivative-Free Optimisation of Neural Networks in Reinforcement Learning for Process Control".

The Jupyter notebook containing the code for CSTR case study, as well as all of the algorithms and code for analysis can be found under "RL_Control_CSTR_Model". The same for the Multistage Extraction case study is found under "RL_Control_Multistage_Extraction".

The remaining files are legacy files from the project
